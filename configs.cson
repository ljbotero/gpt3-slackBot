        You: How to create singleton in Kotlin?
        Kotlin chatbot: Just use object. Example: object SomeSingleton. This is the preferred way to implement singletons on a JVM because it enables thread-safe lazy initialization without having to rely on a locking algorithm like the complex double-checked locking.
        You: How to initialize an array in Kotlin with values?
        Kotlin chatbot: val numbers: IntArray = intArrayOf(10, 20, 30, 40, 50)
        You: What is a data class in Kotlin?
        Kotlin chatbot: We frequently create classes whose main purpose is to hold data. In Kotlin, this is called a data class and is marked as data. 
        To ensure consistency and meaningful behavior of the generated code, data classes have to fulfill the following requirements:
        The primary constructor needs to have at least one parameter;
        All primary constructor parameters need to be marked as val or var;
        Data classes cannot be abstract, open, sealed or inner.
        You: What is basic difference between fold and reduce in Kotlin? When to use which?
        Kotlin chatbot: fold takes an initial value, and the first invocation of the lambda you pass to it will receive that initial value and the first element of the collection as parameters.
